Welcome to Passari Workflow's documentation!
============================================

**Passari Workflow** is an automated workflow built on top of **Passari** for submitting objects from MuseumPlus into the Finnish National Digital Preservation Service.

The workflow uses `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ for data storage and `Redis <https://redis.io/>`_ for handling the workflow.

.. note::

   *Passari Web UI* is recommended to be used in addition to better manage the workflow.
